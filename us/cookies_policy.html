            <p><b>Last Updated:</b> March 15, 2025</p>
            <p>This Cookies Policy explains how Omega Energy ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website (the "Website"). This policy should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which provides more details about how we process your personal information.</p>
        
            <p><b>1. What are Cookies?</b></p>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies can be either "session" cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) or "persistent" cookies (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them). Cookies can also be "first-party" cookies (set by the website you are visiting) or "third-party" cookies (set by a domain other than the website you are visiting).</p>
        
            <p><b>2. How We Use Cookies</b></p>
            <p>We use cookies for various purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</b> These cookies are essential for the operation of our Website and enable you to navigate and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>
                <li><b>Performance/Analytics Cookies:</b> These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Website, such as which pages they go to most often and if they get error messages from web pages. This helps us to improve the way our Website works. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand how customers arrive at our site, browse or use our site and highlight areas where we can improve areas such as navigation, shopping experience and product marketing.</li>
                <li><b>Functionality Cookies:</b> These cookies allow our Website to remember choices you make (such as your language or region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.</li>
                <li><b>Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</b> These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><b>3. Third-Party Cookies</b></p>
            <p>We may also use third-party cookies on our Website. These cookies are set by a domain other than the Omega Energy website. We use third-party cookies for:</p>

                <li><b>Advertising:</b> To deliver targeted advertisements and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>
                <li><b>Social Media Integration:</b> To enable you to share content from our Website on social media platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These third-party providers have their own privacy policies and cookie policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>
        
            <p><b>4. Your Choices Regarding Cookies</b></p>
            <p>You have several options to manage how cookies are used on your device:</p>
            <ul>

You can typically block or delete cookies, or set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent. Please refer to your browser's help documentation for instructions on how to manage your cookie preferences.</li>
                <li><b>Cookie Consent Banner:</b> When you first visit our Website, you will typically see a cookie consent banner that allows you to manage your preferences for non-essential cookies. You can adjust your settings at any time through this banner or a similar mechanism on our Website.</li>
            </ul>
